Requirements:
* Python 2.4+
* PyGTK 2.6+
* gksu (not needed if you use the consolekit patch)

Optional Requirements:
* consolekit (if you want to use consolekit rather than /sbin/shutdown and gksudo)
* pm-utils (if you want suspend and hibernate support but no consolekit)
* upower (if you want suspend and hibernate support with consolekit)

To install this program, copy it to a location in the system $PATH, or store
it elsewhere and create a symbolic link to it in $PATH. The program itself
does not require any more installation.

You will need to add the users you wish to grant permission to use this
program to /etc/sudoers; see sudoers(5). It is recommended you give your user
permission to use the /sbin/shutdown program without a password, though not
necessary (but the user will be prompted for a password). In any case, your
users need permission to execute /sbin/shutdown through sudo, with or without
a password.

To apply one of the patches, use the patch utility:
patch pygtk-shutdown PATCHNAME.patch
