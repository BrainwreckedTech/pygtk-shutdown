To install this program, copy it to a location in the system $PATH, or store
it elsewhere and create a symbolic link to it in $PATH. The program itself
does not require any more installation.

You will need to add the users you wish to grant permission to use this
program to /etc/sudoers; see sudoers(5). It is recommended you give your user
permission to use the /sbin/shutdown program without a password, though not
necessary (but the user will be prompted for a password). In any case, your
users need permission to execute /sbin/shutdown through sudo, with or without
a password.

An alternative would be to give /sbin/shutdown SUID root, though this is far
less secure than using the sudoers method.
