To use this program, assert it is located in your $PATH. Then, simply run it
like any other program. You will be presented with a dialog asking you whether
you want to logout, reboot or shutdown. Reboot and shutdown should work out of
the box (if you have permission - see below); logout will only work without
further configuration if you are using Openbox.

To use logout from different window managers, export the environment variable
LOGOUT_COMMAND, setting it to the command needed to perform a logout from your
window manager. Alternatively, you can leave LOGOUT_COMMAND unset and specify
the command as an argument to pygtk-shutdown. In this case, there is no
need to escape the command, as it will be taken as a literal string.

There are included patches for support for consolekit, consolekit+upower, or pm-utils

Notice: in order to use pygtk-shutdown, the user you are calling it as
must have sudo permission to execute /sbin/shutdown. See INSTALL and
sudoers(5) for more information.
